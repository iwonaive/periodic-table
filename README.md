# Periodic table 

This project features a dynamic table displaying periodic elements with the following columns: number, name, weight, and symbol. Upon application startup, data is simulated to populate the table. Users can edit any value in the displayed records through a popup with an input field for changes. Once the changes are confirmed, the table row updates without mutating the underlying data.
Additionally, the project includes a filtering functionality, allowing users to filter results based on all fields using a single input. The filtering occurs 2 seconds after the user stops typing, enhancing the user experience without immediate input changes.
